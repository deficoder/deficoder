## [Refold Roadmap](https://refold.la)

### Language Learn Approach

- Skill-building is the right choice if you need to speak quickly, but this approach doesn't work for attaining fluency: [Language Hacking Courses](https://languagehacking.com/books)

- Immersion is the tool we use to acquire language. Immersion simply means exposing yourself to the language by watching TV, reading books, and browsing the internet

### The Refold method is made up of three main activities

1. Active immersion: When you pay full attention to your immersion

2. Passive listening: When you listen to immersion throughout the day

3. Active study: When you study vocabulary and grammar

Each plays an important role in the language acquisition process

#### Active Immersion

- **Intensive Immersion** is when you use a dictionary to try to understand your immersion content. This process is great for learning new vocabulary and building comprehension

- **Free-Flow Immersion** is when you pay full attention to a piece of content, but you avoid interrupting your immersion with lookups. Free-flow helps make comprehension more automatic and effortless.

***Balance: both are important parts of the acquisition process. make sure you do some of each***

#### Passive Listening

Passive listening is when you pay partial attention to audio. Passive listening is a great way to increase your total amount of immersion time

It's not as effective as active immersion, but it still helps a lot

Not all passive listening is equal. The more attention you pay while listening, the more benefit you'll get

Relistening also gives your brain another chance to acquire things you missed on your first watch

#### Active Study

Refold is an immersion-based learning method but that doesn't mean we only recommend immersion. Active study is when you spend time learning about your TL to make your immersion more comprehensible

Acquisition happens when you understand the meaning of sentences in your immersion content. Active study gives your brain extra information that it can use to decode the meaning of those sentences

There are four parts of each language to study:

1. Phonetics
2. Writing system
3. Vocabulary
4. Grammar

### Four stages In Refold's Roadmap:

1. Learn the Basics, You will focus on building habits, learning the writing, phonetic systems of the language and learning basic grammar and vocabulary

2. Learn to Understand: build your comprehension until you can fully understand a genre of native content
    - 2A. Understand Simple Content, such as children's TV shows
    - 2B. Follow Your Interests, you have enough of a foundation to start pursuing your interests
    - 2C. Narrow Your Focus, choose any domain you like (e.g. science fiction, fashion, cooking), recommend focusing on slice-of-life TV first

3. Learn to Speak: focuses on converting your comprehension into speaking ability
    - 3A. Understand Casual Conversation
    - 3B. Practice Writing and Pronunciation
    - 3C. Start Speaking, achieved basic fluency in your TL. Your thoughts will go directly into your TL and you will be able to speak naturally and comfortably

4. Expand Your Ability: we explain different approaches to expanding and deepening your language ability
    - choose to expand your comprehension abilities by immersing in new domains like biology, business, or politics
    - choose to deepen your fluency and focus on trying to sound more native-like

Each stage is broken into substages. Each substage has different goals, strategies, and advice to help you focus your effort on what’s most beneficial for where you are in the process

### Once you've read the guide, use the following test to find your level and which stage to start with

1. Can you read the writing system? Do you know 1000 words?

    - If not, go to Stage 1. If yes to both, go to Stage 2A

2. Can you recognize most of the words in a TV show for children (7+ years old) while watching with TL subtitles?

    - If yes, go to Stage 2B

3. Can you follow the plot of a TV show for adults (16+ years old) while watching with TL subtitles?

    - If yes, go to Stage 2C

4. Do you have a near-perfect comprehension of a TV show for adults (16+) without any subtitles?

    - If yes, go to Stage 3A

5. Are you conversationally fluent in your TL, but want to continue deepening and expanding your fluency?

    - If yes, go to Stage 4

## Stage 1

The purpose of Stage 1 is to `create a foundation for comprehension` so that you can learn directly from target language (TL) content in Stage 2

### 1A Immersion

Immersion is the foundation of language acquisition. The amount of time you spend immersing is the single most important factor in how fast you acquire your target language (TL)

#### Tolerating Ambiguity

Immersing in content you don't understand feels uncomfortable. The better you become at tolerating the discomfort, the more you will enjoy your immersion and the faster your brain will absorb the language

#### Reducing Ambiguity

- **Spoil the Plot** Both of these approaches allow you to follow the story without needing to understand the words

    - One way to reduce ambiguity is to read the plot summary of the TV show or movie before watching

    - Another option is to rewatch a TV show or movie that you’ve already seen in your native language (NL)

- **Native Language Subtitles** generally don't recommend

#### Immersion Endurance

Make sure to take frequent breaks and naps to recharge. Over time, your endurance will grow until you can immerse for multiple hours straight

#### Finding Content

Throughout your learning journey, you will spend thousands of hours immersing in your TL, so it's important to find content you enjoy

- **Make New Accounts** We recommend creating TL accounts on `YouTube`, `Netflix`, `Tiktok`, and `Twitter`, you can take advantage of the recommendation algorithm to find new and interesting content

- **Netflix** We recommend using the [Unofficial Netflix Online Global Search DB](https://unogs.com) [a detailed guide for setting up a TL Netflix account](https://www.lindsaydoeslanguages.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-netflix-for-language-learning)

- **TL Streaming Services** Every country has different streaming services apart from Netflix and Youtuve, Search Google for the streaming sites most used by natives of your TL

#### Passive Listening Content

Passive listening is a great way to increase your immersion time when you're on the go.

- Re-listening to the audio from TV shows or YouTube videos that you've already actively watched

- Podcasts and audiobooks are the most straightforward way to start passive listening, but they will be very difficult for new learners

To make passive listening a habit in your life: download the audio and put it on your phone or a separate digital audio player

### 1A Language Basics

Active study helps you build this foundation much faster than immersion alone

There are four parts to active study:

#### 1.Phonetics

Each language has a unique set of sounds that are different from other languages. The ability to hear these sounds comes from hundreds of hours of listening practice. You can speed up this process by learning about the phonetics of your TL

***Don't practice pronunciation until you can accurately hear the phonetics of the language. If you do, you may get a bad accent that will be hard to undo later***

#### 2.Writing system

Each language has different tools for learning the writing system. Don't try to perfectly learn the writing system through study. Just learn the basics. Reading is a core part of the Refold Roadmap, so you will have plenty of opportunities to master the writing system over time

#### 3.Vocabulary

The fastest way to boost your comprehension is to learn the 1000 most common words. The 1000 most common words cover 70-80% of daily speech

Once you have a foundation and can comprehend some of your immersion, you will start to study vocabulary directly from your immersion content instead of from a vocabulary list

**Study Tools** Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) are, by far, the most effective memorization tool. The best SRS tool currently available is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) or [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com)

**Study Strategy** In immersion learning, your goal is to understand; not speak. That means that you only need to build your passive vocabulary: the set of words you can recognize and understand

**Choosing a Word List**

- Choosing a Premade Deck: In a good premade deck, each card will have a word, an example sentence, a definition, and ideally, audio for the word/sentence

- Creating Your Own Deck
    - Choose the words you want to learn. The best way to do this is with a `frequency list`
    - When choosing a frequency list, make sure that it’s a list of root words, not conjugated/inflected words
    - Gather the necessary information for each word and load it into Anki

**SRS Best Practices** Focus on consistency over quantity. We recommend adding 10 new cards per day. With 10 new cards per day, you should expect to have about 70 reviews per day

#### 4.Basic grammar

There is no why. It's important to realize that `grammar rules` aren't actually rules. They're just guidelines for how the language is generally used

Grammar study is not useful for speaking fluently because it’s impossible to memorize every rule and exception

Fortunately, our brains are really good at learning grammar intuitively. Through immersion, you will gain an intuitive understanding of the language so that you can speak correctly without needing to think about grammar

**Comprehension Focus** Although grammar study isn't useful for speaking, it is very useful for comprehension. While vocabulary study helps you understand individual words, grammar study helps you understand full sentences

Start by reading about the basic grammar of your TL for 10-15 minutes per day. As you see new grammar structures in your immersion, read about how they work

Most of your grammar study probably won't make sense until after you've immersed and seen many examples. If something doesn't make sense, then skip it. You'll eventually figure it out through immersion

### 2A Intensive Immersion

When first getting started, books and blogs will be too difficult to read. Instead, we recommend reading target language (TL) subtitles while watching a TV show. There are four main reasons why we recommend starting with subtitles:

1. The visuals of the TV show provide extra context that helps you understand
2. The audio of the TV show will help you learn the correct pronunciation of the words you’re reading
3. Hearing the subtitles pronounced out loud helps you parse the grammar of sentences
4. Subtitles are the written text of a conversation. Conversation generally contains easier language than novels and blogs

#### How to Intensively Immerse

During intensive immersion, your goal is to understand as much as possible. To do this, stop after each subtitle line and try to understand the sentence. If there are unknown words in the sentence, use a dictionary to look them up

Only focus on the easy things: As your comprehension grows, the things that used to be hard will become easy

#### What Content to Watch

**Subtitles** As a beginner, matching subtitles are important so you can hear the correct pronunciation of words. If you can’t find any TL content with subtitles, then we recommend doing intensive immersion with comic books instead

**Children's Content** We recommend starting with TV shows for children `aged 7 to 14`. Children's TV shows have simpler storylines and dialogue, which make them easier to understand

**Rewatching Content** Increasing comprehension is the best way to accelerate acquisition. The more comprehensible something is, the more engaging it will be and the more your brain will be able to learn

One great strategy for increasing comprehension and engagement is `to watch content twice: once free-flow and once intensive`

#### Avoiding Burnout

Intensive immersion can be mentally exhausting. It takes a lot of energy and focus. When you get tired of intensive immersion, switch to free-flow immersion

There's no point in forcing yourself to immerse with content. Enjoyment is the most important part of the process

#### Immersion Tools

#### Finding Subtitled Content

**YouTube** [advanced search feature](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3029103?hl=en)

**Netflix** any content orginally created in your TL will have matching subtitles

**TL Streaming Services** Remember to branch out and try new media streaming sites. Every country has its own media and streaming services. These services will likely have a lot of content available with matching subtitles

### 2A Sentence Mining

Sentence mining is the process of finding new words from your immersion and making Anki cards to learn them. Sentence mining is powerful because it allows you to learn the words that are most relevant to your personal immersion experience

***We recommend learning at least 1000 words before starting to sentence mine***

#### Sentences, Not Words

We highly recommend putting an example sentence on each of your cards. Cards with only a word and its definition cause multiple problems in the learning process:

1. Most words have multiple meanings. Learning all of these meanings at the same time is too difficult. Choosing an example sentence allows you to narrow your focus down to the single meaning that's relevant to that sentence. In this way, learning one meaning at a time is a much more effective way to learn vocabulary

2. A word alone is hard to remember. Adding an example sentence adds extra context to the word. Instead of an abstract idea or concept, the sentence helps fill in a concrete image that's easier for your brain to latch onto and remember

3. Words aren't used alone. When the word is by itself without any surrounding context, you don't know how it's used when combined with other words. An example sentence shows you how the word fits into the broader language

#### How to Choose Sentences

Not every sentence is good for learning. There are two major criteria you should consider when deciding if a sentence is a good example for a word. Sentences that meet both of these criteria are called 1T sentences:

1. A single unknown element. A good example sentence should only have one unknown word or grammar structure. If there are multiple unknowns, don't use that sentence

2. Perfect comprehension. When you look up the definition of the unknown word or the explanation of the unknown grammar structure, the meaning of the sentence as a whole should become clear to you

#### How to Choose Words

Not every word is worth learning. To decide on which words to learn, use the following criteria:

1. Does the word seem like it would be useful in everyday conversation?
2. Is the word necessary to understand your immersion content?
3. Have you seen this word before? Does the word feel familiar?
4. Is the word personally interesting to you?

If the answer is yes to any of those questions, then you should learn the word

#### When to Mine

Intensive immersion is the best time to sentence mine. You are already doing word lookups and trying to understand sentences so it's easy to pick out good 1T sentences in the process

There are multiple methods for creating cards from mined sentences:

1. Create cards while you immerse (synchronous mining)
2. Save sentences you want to learn and then create cards later (asynchronous mining)
3. Use software to automatically create cards (automatic mining)

Synchronous mining is the most popular method in the community, so we recommend starting with that. There are many tools available to help make synchronous mining easy

#### How to Create Cards

There are many different card formats you can use. We recommend starting with cards that only contain text because they are easiest to create. Once you are comfortable with Anki, you can create cards with pictures and audio

**Sentence card format**

- Front: Example sentence
- Back: Definition of target word

### 2A Measuring Comprehension

We've created a system to help you evaluate your comprehension based on how much of the meaning you understand

#### Comprehension Levels

The comprehension levels below describe the stages between zero comprehension and full, native-like comprehension

<table align="center">
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th colspan=2 align="center"><b>Refold Roadmap Comprehension Levels</b></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">Level 0: Nothing</td>
        <td>You don't understand any of the language</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">Level 1: Something</td>
        <td>You can recognize some individual words</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">Level 2: Bits and Pieces</td>
        <td>You can recognize at least one word in almost every sentence</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan=2 align="center">Level 3: Gist</td>
        <td>You recognize around half the words used</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You can understand the meaning of some full sentences</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan=2 align="center">Level 4: Story</td>
        <td>You understand the meaning of most sentences</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You can follow the story, but miss some ideas and plot points</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan=2 align="center">Level 5: Comfortable</td>
        <td>You understand nearly every sentence but miss an occasional word or phrase</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You may not understand jokes, puns, or nuance</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>It still requires effort to understand</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">Level 6: Automatic</td>
        <td>You understand everything effortlessly</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Comprehension Varies

It's important to realize that you will have a different comprehension levels with different pieces of content

#### Testing Your Comprehension

We use the comprehension levels above to determine when you are ready to move on to the next substage. The one constant between the tests is that you should not be using dictionary lookups

Each substage provides a self-test to measure your comprehension. These tests explain which type of content to use and how to execute the test. As you progress through the substages, you will use more difficult content and fewer tools to support your comprehension

#### Level Up

To move from 2A to 2B, you should have level 3 comprehension of content aimed at adolescents. Remember, level 3 comprehension means that you can recognize more than half of the words

To test yourself to see if you’re ready to move to 2B, choose a children's TV show (aimed at ages 7-14) that has subtitles. Watch the show with the subtitles, pausing to read each line. Turn off your pop-up dictionaries so that you’re not tempted to look at definitions or translations

If you can recognize most of the words and you can understand some full sentences, then you're ready to move on to Stage 2B. Congratulations!

### 2B Immersion Guide

The goal in Stage 2B is to get to level 4 comprehension with a genre of native content
